# DecoitoDMiniChallenge_SayHello_2


API Practice stuff

reviewed by: Freddy Aguilar - The program takes their mini challenge 2 and converts it int API format. it takes the input from the user, their name, and outputs it into Postman in a sentence greeting them by name. The program works as intended ! Good job!
